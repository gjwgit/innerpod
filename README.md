# InnerPod

A session timer with sessions logged to your [Solid
Pod](https://solidproject.org/about).

You can try it out online at https://innerpod.solidcommunity.au. We
also welcome testers of the Android app at

InnerPod is an app for timing sessions and storing (not yet released)
sessions in your Solid Pod. A session can be anything though the app
is commonly used for meditation.

The app is written in
[Flutter](https://survivor.togaware.com/gnulinux/flutter.html) and the
open source code is available from
[github](https://github.com/gjwgit/innerpod).

## Using the App

In Version 1.3.0 and later a login screen is displayed on startup.

If you do not wish to record your session to your Solid Pod simply tap
SESSION. The session timer is fully functional without a connection
and no data is collected or stored.

Otherwise, from the login screen you can connect to your Solid Pod, if
you have one. Tap REGISTER to sign up for your personally private
Solid Pod. All data is encrypted on the Pod and only you have access
to the data on your device, unless you explicitly share the data.

Tap on LOGIN to establish a connection to your Solid Pod. Once a
connection is made then the session will be logged and previous
sessions will be available for visualising.

To get your own new pod on https://pods.solidcommunity.au tap on
REGISTER.

Tap on the INFO button to review this guide.

The SESSION manager displays a countdown timer and buttons to interact
and manage the session. On START three dings are donged. The three
dings get donged again at the end of the session. The INTRO plays a
short guide on how to meditate from [John
Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Main).
