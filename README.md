# InnerPod

A session timer with sessions logged to your [Solid
Pod](https://solidproject.org/about).

You can try it out online at https://innerpod.solidcommunity.au.

InnerPod is an app for timing sessions and storing sessions in your
Pod. A session can be anything though the app is commonly used for
meditation.

The app is written in
[Flutter](https://survivor.togaware.com/gnulinux/flutter.html) and the
open source code is available from
[github](https://github.com/gjwgit/innerpod).

## Using the App

The login screen is displayed on startup and is used to (optionally)
connect to your Solid Pod, if you have one. Tap REGISTER to sign up
for your personally private Solid Pod. All data is encrypted on the
Pod and only you have access to the data on your device, unless you
explicitly share the data.

Tap on LOGIN to establish a connection to your Solid Pod. Once a
connection is made then the session will be logged and previous
sessions will be available for visualising.

Tap on SESSION to skip the connection. The session timer is fully
functional without a connection.

To get your own new pod on https://pods.solidcommunity.au tap on
REGISTER.

Tap on the INFO button to review this guide.

The SESSION manager displays a countdown timer and buttons to interact
and manage the session. On START three dings are donged. The three
dings get donged again at the end of the session. The INTRO plays a
short guide on how to meditate from [John
Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Main).
